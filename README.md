# Project Euler

This is an ongoing project that I add to as I make progress.  All the logic is built into the algorithms file and the buttons simply display the answers generated.

This site is NOT an answer guide.  It is only to demonstrate my personal logic and problem solving skills. 

Please note that some of the answers may take some time to generate.  According to Project Euler, if an answer takes less than 60 seconds, it is considered optimized and a passing solution. Therefore if an answer takes a little time to load, it is not a delay in the site, but rather the logic taking time to complete the complex calculations which runs in real time on button click.
